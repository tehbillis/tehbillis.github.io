Hi, my name is William Green, but feel free to just call me Will. I'm a long time tech enthusiast, my interests in the area have touched on software creation, hardware and network administration, PC building, and of course Gaming.

My main interest these days has been my family, particularly my duaghter. Somehow she seems to dominate my time and attention, if you get to know her I'm sure you'll see why. But I'm more than just a nerdy dad. I enjoy offline activities as well. I enjoy cooking, following and tweaking recipes is something I find to be great fun and I love sharing things that I make from scratch. Board games and card games are an activity that I have loved since childhood. I have been slowly starting a vinyl record collection over the years and have no intention of stopping just yet. Ever since my partner found me, she has thrust me into the world of houseplants and I can't say that I regret it in any way. It's kinda like gardening indoors, and since I enjoy gardening outdoors it seems to fit my interests. I enjoy being handy and building things, I can't say I'm and expert at anything just yet, but I have journied through wood carving, knife making, home repair, home brewing both wine and mead, and have been enjoying the search for that single passion hobby along the way.
