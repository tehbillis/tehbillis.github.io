Hello, and welcome to beginning of my exciting journey back into the world of software development! My name is Will, and I'm excited to say that after taking a few steps back a little over 10 years ago from software development I have decided that it's time for me to return. Despite my previous experience, both in the classroom and in the field, I have decided that the best rout for me will be to jump back into what is now the industry standard and get some consistent practice in an organized and structured environment. I plan on achieving this by completing a coding bootcamp with a local company called Code fellows.

My intended purpose of this blog is somewhat multifunctional, but should also be fairly simple. First I would like to document my learning journey through the bootcamp by talking about what I'm currently mastering, any areas that I may feel is a challenge for me, or even just rambling about things that I particularly enjoy. I also plan on showcasing the projects that I will be working in in class, as well as any that I decide to work on outside of school. I hope that my posts and projects will be a kind of living portfolio, and a great way to show my growth as a software developer as time goes on.

There are a few reason why I'm creating this blog. I'm hoping, first and foremost, that it will help me solidify the knowledge that I'm trying to master in software development, problem solving, and even my writing and communication skills. It also seemed to me like an excellent way to track my progress in a much more accessible way than just keeping it in my head. My final motivation for writing this blog is to connect with the greater community and try to learn from them and maybe even inspire others on their own personal journey.

In this blog you can expect to see some of the coursework that I am working on and my thought process on how I understand it. You will see the skills I am mastering, the challenges I am working through, and the projects I will complete. I sincerely hope that you will see the quality of this blog as well as my skills improve as time goes on.

Like many, my interest in software probably began when I found out that I could customize my MySpace profile by injecting custom css, but I began my coding career in high school when I took an introductory C++ course. The next two years I spend half my school days at a tech center that simulated a workplace, learning the basics of software development. I entered the industry my senior year of high school as a QA Manual Tester and moved on from there to a jr. software dev position. I was actually lucky enough to work with my older brother who was a big influence on my love for technology and software. From there I moved into a frontend dev position for a couple of years before stepping away for personal reasons.

It has been 17 years since I left school, so jumping into code fellowâ€™s coding bootcamp is an exciting prospect to me. I'm looking forward to learning the react framework, and to mastering HTML & CSS. I'm ready to start the adventure from step 1 all the way to mastery.

I'm not entirely certain of where I desire to end up in the industry, nor do I know just yet how I will be contributing. But I do know that I want to contribute in a positive way and help others. I want the world that I leave to my daughter to be better than how I found it.

I'm excited to share, and hope that you will enjoy following me in my journey back into the software industry as I work my way through school, and maybe even beyond as I enter the workforce. I want to thank you all for supporting me, and I hope that we can learn from each other.

If you would like to reach out to me for any reason, please feel free. I look forward to connecting with you!
